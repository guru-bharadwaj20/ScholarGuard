# ScholarGuard Integrity Report — PMC13344374.pdf

- **Generated:** 2026-07-10T08:21:21
- **Status:** completed
- **Overall paper risk:** **HIGH** (score 64.96/100, 7 figure(s))

## ⚠ Pipeline notes (degraded / skipped steps)
- claim-consistency will be SKIPPED for all figures: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set. Export your Claude API key, e.g.
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...      (bash)
  $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = 'sk-ant-...'    (PowerShell)
or place it in a .env file (python-dotenv is loaded automatically). (set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to enable text/claim checking)
- AI-generation running in FORENSICS-ONLY mode: classifier weights not found at 'src/models/weights/artifact_classifier.pt' (train via the Stage 4 Colab notebook to enable the learned signal)
